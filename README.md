## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Objective
To analyze how various factors (like gender, parental education, and test preparation) influence student scores in math, reading, and writing. This project involves:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic visualizations
- Simple regression model

## 📊 Key Insights
- Students who completed test preparation scored higher on average.
- Female students performed better in reading and writing.
- Parental education level has a mild influence on scores.

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Target**: Predict math score
- **Accuracy**: ~88%

## 📁 Dataset Source
The dataset is taken from [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
